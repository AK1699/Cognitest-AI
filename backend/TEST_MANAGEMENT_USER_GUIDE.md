**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Navigate to Test Plans**
   - Go to your project â†’ Test Management â†’ Test Plans

2. **Click "Create Test Plan"**

3. **Fill in Details:**
   ```
   Name: e.g., "User Authentication Test Plan"
   Description: Comprehensive testing of login, logout, and session management
   Objectives:
     - Verify login with valid credentials
     - Test password reset flow
     - Validate session timeout
     - Check multi-factor authentication
   Tags: authentication, security, critical
   ```

4. **Save**
   - Click "Create Test Plan"
   - Your test plan is now created!

**API Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test-plans/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "your-project-uuid",
    "name": "User Authentication Test Plan",
    "description": "Comprehensive testing of login, logout, and session management",
    "objectives": [
      "Verify login with valid credentials",
      "Test password reset flow",
      "Validate session timeout"
    ],
    "tags": ["authentication", "security"],
    "generated_by": "manual",
    "created_by": "your-email@example.com"
  }'
```

### Method 2: AI-Powered Generation (Coming Soon)

**What You Need:**
