# RBAC Frontend Implementation Checklist

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Base Files
Copy these files to your React project:

```bash
# Create folders
mkdir -p src/services
mkdir -p src/contexts
mkdir -p src/components/permissions

# Copy service
cp RBAC_QUICKSTART_EXAMPLE.tsx src/services/rbac.service.ts

# Extract and create context
# (Extract PermissionContext from example)

# Extract and create component
# (Extract Can component from example)
```

### Step 2: Wrap Your App
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
import { PermissionProvider } from './contexts/PermissionContext';

function App() {
  const { user } = useAuth(); // Your existing auth
  const { currentProject } = useProject(); // Your project context

  return (
    <PermissionProvider
      userId={user.id}
      projectId={currentProject.id}
    >
      {/* Your app routes */}
    </PermissionProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Use in Components
```typescript
import { Can } from './components/permissions/Can';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Can do="create_test_case">
        <button>Create Test Case</button>
      </Can>

      <Can role="administrator">
        <button>Admin Panel</button>
      </Can>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üé® UI Components Needed

### Existing Components to Enhance:
- [ ] Button - Add `requirePermission` prop

## üí° Code Snippets for Common Tasks

### 1. Hide Button Based on Permission
```typescript
<Can do="delete_test_case">
  <Button variant="danger" onClick={handleDelete}>
    Delete
  </Button>
</Can>
```

### 2. Disable Form Field
```typescript
const canEdit = useHasPermission('update_test_case');

<input
  disabled={!canEdit}
  className={!canEdit ? 'read-only' : ''}
/>
```

### 3. Conditional Navigation
```typescript
const { hasPermission } = usePermissions();

{hasPermission('manage_settings') && (
  <Link to="/settings">Settings</Link>
)}
```

### 4. Check Multiple Permissions
```typescript
<Can any={['create_test_plan', 'update_test_plan']}>
  <TestPlanEditor />
</Can>
```

### 5. Role-Based Section
```typescript
<Can role="administrator">
  <AdminPanel />
</Can>
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't check permissions on server responses** - Always check on UI first
2. **Always cache permissions** - Don't fetch on every render
3. **Handle loading states** - Show loading indicator while fetching permissions
4. **Provide fallback UI** - Don't just hide, show "why" user can't access
5. **Refresh after role changes** - Update permissions after role assignment
6. **Test with actual users** - Don't just test as admin
7. **Document permission names** - Keep a reference guide
8. **Handle errors gracefully** - API might fail, handle it
9. **Consider mobile UI** - Permission dialogs on small screens
10. **Performance** - Avoid unnecessary permission checks in loops
